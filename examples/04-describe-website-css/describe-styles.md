# Website Style Analysis

You are an expert UI/UX Designer. Your task is to analyze the visual style of the website {{website_url}} based on the provided screenshots and computed styles.

Please output a design system summary in Markdown format covering:

1.  **Color Palette**: Primary, secondary, and accent colors.
2.  **Typography**: Headings and body fonts (family, weight, style).
3.  **UI Components**:
    *   **Buttons**: Shape, color, borders, hover effects.
    *   **Cards/Containers**: Backgrounds, shadows, border radius.
4.  **Layout & Spacing**: Density, whitespace usage, alignment.
5.  **Brand Personality**: The overall mood (e.g., modern, trustworthy, playful).

Do not output CSS code, just a descriptive analysis.
