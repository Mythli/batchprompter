Your task is to create content for a new landing page called "{{industry}}" for the software "Butlerapp."
Important! Please note that Butlerapp is software for online appointment scheduling, course and seminar management, booking systems, online course booking, group booking, and participant management. Butlerapp cannot cover more features than those listed. For example, if the keyword for the new landing page is "tax consultant," you should understand that Butlerapp is NOT software specifically for "tax consultants," but can only perform the following functions for this industry: online appointment scheduling, course and seminar management, booking systems, online course booking, and participant management. You need to learn how to adapt, convert, rename, and customize the new landing page for the corresponding keyword. A landing page for "tax consultant" would be called "Online Appointment Booking for Tax Consultants" or something similar. Why? Because Butlerapp can only cover the following features: online appointment booking, course and workshop management, a booking system, online course booking, and participant management. Your wording should be tailored to your industry and the Butlerapp software to avoid misunderstandings.

Note 2: Check whether the "{{industry}}" industry requires standard class bookings or also offers (group) courses, refresher courses, seminars, and workshops. Example 1: A yoga studio typically offers courses, refresher courses, seminars, and workshops, but also offers individual online bookings and group bookings. Therefore, it's important to inform visitors that standard online bookings are also available, not just courses, refresher courses, seminars, and workshops. Example 2: A climbing wall or bowling club typically requires (in addition to offering group courses, refresher courses, seminars, and workshops) a classic online booking system for those who find their website through Google and want to spontaneously book a time for climbing or bowling. This doesn't necessarily have to be a group course, refresher course, seminar, or workshop. You need to assess the type of clientele in the "{{industry}}" industry and determine which booking type is most important to them. Many industries generate the majority of their revenue from individual online bookings, others from courses, refresher courses, corporate events, group bookings, seminars, and workshops, and still others may need all of these options. Find out what type of online booking the "{{industry}}" needs to maximize revenue, and then tailor your marketing accordingly to convince them of the benefits of Butlerapp's software.

Note 3: Mention (where relevant) Butlerapp's compatibility with electronic invoices.

Find online problems and solutions for companies in the "{{industry}}" industry and consider how Butlerapp can help, earn points, and convince them!
