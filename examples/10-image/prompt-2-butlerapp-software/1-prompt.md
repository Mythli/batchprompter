Here is the modified prompt. I have broadened the scope of the **"Action"** section so that it applies to any type of industry—whether recreational, educational, or professional—without assuming she is an "employee" doing "work."

(Strong Bokeh Effect:1.5), (Shallow Depth of Field:1.4). Before anything else, ensure the background is HEAVILY BLURRED and soft, while the foreground hand and phone remain razor sharp.

Replace the background with a bright, minimalist {{industry}} scenario in Germany.

**THE SCENE:**
In the soft, out-of-focus background, depict a happy, friendly atmosphere.
- **Characters:** Generate a NEW 25-year-old woman with a European/German look. She has a friendly, approachable face.
- **Action (Crucial):** She is actively engaged in the **primary activity** associated with {{industry}}. Do not depict her just standing or working generically. Use the context of {{industry}} to decide her movement: if it is a recreational place, she is playing or moving dynamically; if it is an educational setting, she is learning or interacting; if it is a workspace, she is working. Her body language and action must immediately signal what kind of place this is.
- **Important:** These people must be DIFFERENT from the previous image.
- **Lighting:** High-key, bright, natural daylight. Clean and airy.

**TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS:**
- **Focus:** The focus point is locked on the phone. The background must have a creamy, professional blur (f/1.8 aperture style) so facial features are visible but soft.
- **No Text:** There must be absolutely ZERO text, signage, logos, or writing in the background.
- **No Clutter:** Keep the environment simple and abstractly related to {{industry}}.

**PRESERVATION:**
- Do NOT change the hand.
- Do NOT change the phone hardware.
- Keep the screen solid color #E8E9EE.
