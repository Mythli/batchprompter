Generate a realistic image of a person holding an iPad tablet in a setting appropriate for the industry: {{industry}}.

**Scene Details:**
- **Foreground:** A person is holding the tablet, looking at the screen. We see them from an angle (e.g., over-the-shoulder) so the screen is clearly visible.
- **Background:** A blurred but recognizable background representing a real-world location for **{{industry}}**.
- **Tablet Screen:** The screen must display the software interface from the attached reference image, but with a specific text change.

**Software Interface Modifications:**
- **Reference:** Use the layout and design of the attached software image.
- **Text Replacement:** Change the text "Für Experten" to a specific offer title for **{{industry}}** (e.g., "Für {{industry}}" or "Angebot für {{industry}}").
- Keep the rest of the UI (logo, colors, list items) consistent with the reference.

**Style:**
- Photorealistic, high quality, natural lighting.
