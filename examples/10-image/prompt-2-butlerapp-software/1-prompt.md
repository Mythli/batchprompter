Generate a realistic image of one person holding an iPhone in a setting appropriate for the industry: {{industry}}.

**Scene Details:**
- **Foreground:** One person is holding the iPhone, looking at the screen. We see them from an angle (e.g., over-the-shoulder) so the screen is clearly visible.
- **Background:** A blurred but recognizable background representing a real-world location for **{{industry}}** without other people.
- **Tablet Screen:** The screen must display the software interface from the attached reference image, but modify the booking form.

**Booking form modifications:**
- **Reference:** Use the layout and design of the attached software image.
- **Offer replacement:** Replace the offer presented in the booking form with one which is typical for {{industry}} 
- Keep the rest of the UI (logo, colors, list items) consistent with the reference.

**Style:**
- Photorealistic, high quality, natural lighting.
