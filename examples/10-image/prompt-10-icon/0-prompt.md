You are an expert Swiss Graphic Designer. Create a single, definitive vector pictogram representing the industry: "{{industry}}".

**DESIGN LOGIC (STRICT ADHERENCE):**
1.  **Subject Selection:** Identify the single most iconic tool, object, or body posture associated with the *activity*, not the institution.
    *   *If "{{industry}}" contains "School", "Agency", or "Institute":* IGNORE the academic aspect (no books, diplomas, or buildings). Draw the subject matter only (e.g., for 'Language School' draw a speech bubble or mouth; for 'Driving School' draw a steering wheel).
2.  **Composition:** Center a single, massive shape. Maximize the size to fill 90% of the canvas, creating a "heavy" look, but ensure a 5% safety margin on all sides so no essential parts (heads, tips of tools) are cropped.
3.  **Geometry:** Brutalist and minimal. The shape must be a single fused silhouette (100% solid black). No "floating" separate parts.
4.  **Simplification:** Extreme macro reduction. No outlines, no internal details, no shading, no thin lines. If the object usually has detail (like a keyboard), fuse it into a solid geographic block.

**TECHNICAL SPECS:**
*   **Color:** #000000 (Pure Black) on White background.
*   **Style:** Swiss International Style / Bauhaus Pictogram.
*   **Result:** A bold, high-contrast typographic symbol.

**NEGATIVE PROMPT:**
text, words, letters, realistic, shading, greyscale, thin lines, sketch, detail, stroke, outline, book, graduation cap, building, two separate objects, complex, broken geometry.
