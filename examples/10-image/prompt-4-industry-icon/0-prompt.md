A massive, abstract flat vector silhouette representing the core activity of "{{industry}}". The design must be an extreme macro close-up, creating a heavy graphic shape that deliberately touches the borders of the canvas (full-bleed). 100% solid black. Minimalist Swiss pictogram style. NO academic symbols (no books, no hats, no diplomas). Focus on the "doing" or the "subject" (e.g., for 'Backschule', show the shape of Bread; for 'Fahrschule', show the silhouette of a Car; for 'Alpaka', show the Animal profile). No outlines, no details, isolated on white.
