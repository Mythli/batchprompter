Change the image to have a hardcore, realistic optical blur. The effect should look like "Creamy Bokeh" (f/1.2 aperture) or a strong Gaussian blur, making the specific details of the scene unrecognizable while preserving the light, color atmosphere, and general shapes. The result should look like a professional, abstract photographic background suitable for a UI overlay. Do not change the aspect ratio or add new objects.
