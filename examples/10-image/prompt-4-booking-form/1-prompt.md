**COMPOSITION & SCALE (CRITICAL):**
Compose this shot as an **extreme vertical close-up**. The mobile phone hardware must be perfectly **CENTERED** horizontally and occupy nearly the entire vertical height of the canvas. The hand holding the device must enter decisively from the **left side** of the frame.

**FOCUS STRATEGY & OPTICS:**
**(Optical Depth of Field), (f/1.2 Aperture), (Natural Focus Falloff).**
1.  **Focal Plane:** A strict focus plane is set on the **Phone Screen and Phone Case**. They must be **RAZOR SHARP**.
2.  **Natural Falloff:** The focus should roll off naturally past the hand.
3.  **Background:** Render the background with **"Creamy Bokeh"** (smooth, aesthetic out-of-focus areas). The background noise and people should turn into soft, circular blobs of light and color, mimicking high-end lens optics rather than digital blurring.

**STYLE:** **Cinematic Industrial Photography.**
(Canon EOS R5), **(85mm Prime Lens @ f/1.2)**, (Photorealistic rendering), (Soft Optical Blur).

**THE SCENE:**
A bright {{industry}} environment in Germany. The image serves as an atmospheric backdrop.

-   **NO PROTAGONIST:** There is **NO specific subject** behind the phone.
-   **Background Atmosphere:** The background consists of **anonymous shapes of people** active in the {{industry}}.
-   *Visuals:* We view the scene through a lens with extreme subject separation. 
-   **Lighting:** **Natural Scene Lighting.** High-key, bright daylight. Soft specular highlights on the phone edges.

**PRESERVATION & FRAMING:**
-   **Hand:** Enters from the **left**.
-   **Hardware:** Do NOT change the phone hardware.
-   **Spacing:** The phone fills the vertical space.
-   **Screen:** Keep the screen solid color #E8E9EE.

**CRITICAL - MANDATORY EXCLUSIONS:**
1.  **NO SHARP FACES:** The background depth of field is so shallow that faces are unrecognizable soft shapes.
2.  **NO READABLE TEXT:** **(Strict Constraint)** Any background text is rendered as distinct "bokeh balls" or soft blurs, absolutely illegible.
3.  **NO DIGITAL BLUR:** The blur must look unmistakably optical (variable depth), not a flat digital filter.
