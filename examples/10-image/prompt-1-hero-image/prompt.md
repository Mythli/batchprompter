**CRITICAL - IMAGE EXCLUSIONS:**
**ABSOLUTELY NO TEXT, NO LETTERS, NO NUMBERS, NO LOGOS, NO WATERMARKS, NO SIGNAGE, NO BRANDING.** The environment, objects, and clothing must be completely plain and unbranded. Verify that there is no writing on walls or shirts.

(Shallow Depth of Field:1.4), (Bokeh Effect), (Cinematic Focus). **Isolate the subject visually.**

Create a bright, minimalist {{industry}} scenario in Germany.

**THE SCENE:**
A happy, friendly atmosphere.
- **The Protagonist (FOCUS POINT):** Center the image on a cute, attractive young woman (aged 20-30) with a European/German look. She is beaming with joy and radiates authentic positive emotions. She is not wearing clothing with words or logos.
- **Contextual Interaction (Optional):** **If** the {{industry}} naturally involves immediate interaction (e.g., dancing, childcare, nursing, coaching), include a partner, child, or client interacting directly with her. **This distinct partner/child should largely share the focus plane with the protagonist.**
- **Action (Crucial):** She is actively engaged in the **primary activity** associated with {{industry}}. Do not depict her just standing or working generically. Use the context of {{industry}} to decide her movement (e.g., swinging a child, holding a dance pose, shaking hands, or working solo).
- **Background & Supporting Characters:** Include *other* people typical for this industry deep in the background. **These background figures must be HEAVILY BLURRED.** They provide context but do not distract from the main girl (and her optional partner).

**TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS:**
- **Lens Style:** Simulate a high-end portrait lens (f/1.4 aperture). Focus is locked on the protagonist's eyes/face (and her immediate partner if present). The transition to the creamy, blurred background must be smooth.
- **Lighting:** High-key, bright, natural daylight. Clean and airy.
- **Zero Clutter:** Keep the environment simple and abstractly related to {{industry}}. All walls and surfaces must be clean.
