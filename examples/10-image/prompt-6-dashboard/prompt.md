Replace the background of the picture with a bright, atmospheric scene representing a {{industry}}, while leaving the foreground completely untouched.

**1. STRICT FOREGROUND PRESERVATION (DO NOT CHANGE):**
*   **Composition:** The tablet MUST continue to dominate the frame, occupying nearly the entire visual area in landscape mode. The hands must remain gripped on the left and right edges.
*   **Screen Color:** The tablet screen must remain a completely flat, solid light grey **#E8E9EE**. Do not add reflections or content to the screen.
*   **Sharpness:** The hands and the black bezel of the tablet must remain razor-sharp.

**2. BACKGROUND REPLACEMENT:**
*   **Theme:** Generate the atmosphere of a **{{industry}}**.
*   **Context Awareness:** Use colors, lighting, and vague shapes appropriate for this specific setting (e.g., if "Sailing School": blues/water/bright sun; if "Kindergarten": wooden textures/toys/pastel colors).
*   **Optics (Heavy Blur):** The background must be rendered as "Creamy Bokeh" (f/1.2 aperture). All context from the {{industry}} must be blurred into soft, unrecognizable blobs of color and light to create 100% subject separation.
*   **Exclusions:** NO sharp faces, NO readable text, NO digital noise.
