Generate a bright, atmospheric background scene representing a {{industry}}.

**1. BACKGROUND STYLE:**
*   **Theme:** Generate the atmosphere of a **{{industry}}**.
*   **Activity:** Include people in the background performing the primary and secondary activities of the {{industry}}.
*   **Context Awareness:** Use colors, lighting, and vague shapes appropriate for this specific setting (e.g., if "Sailing School": blues/water/bright sun; if "Kindergarten": wooden textures/toys/pastel colors).
*   **Optics (Heavy Blur):** The background must be rendered as "Creamy Bokeh" (f/1.2 aperture). The scene should be blurred, but the shapes of people and their activities should still be discernible as part of the atmosphere.
*   **Exclusions:** NO sharp faces, NO readable text, NO digital noise. NO foreground objects.
