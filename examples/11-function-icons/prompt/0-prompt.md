**ROLE:**
You are a Senior UX/UI Designer. Your philosophy is "Radical Clarity."
You are designing flat, heavy vector icons for "Butlerapp" (a functional course booking software).

**TASK:**
Create a single, massive, flat vector pictogram for: "**{{name}}**".

**DESIGN PROCESS (How to think):**
Do not follow valid rules. Instead, ask yourself: *"What is the most immediate mental image a user has for this concept?"*

1.  **Detect the "Active" Element:**
    *   **Is it a Brand?** (e.g., WordPress, Zoom): Just draw the **Logo**. That is the only thing the user recognizes.
    *   **Is it an Action?** (e.g., **Export**, Send, **Reference**): You MUST visualize the movement. A document alone is not an export. An "Invoice Export" needs a **Document with a Down Arrow**. A "Data Transfer" needs **Two Arrows**.
    *   **Is it a Feature?** (e.g., Customizable Design, Flexible Payments): **Ignore the adjectives.** A user doesn't visualize "Flexible," they visualize "Money." Draw the distinct physical object (A Credit Card, A Paintbrush).

2.  **Simplify for "Glanceability":**
    *   If you combine two ideas, make sure they form **one shape**.
    *   *Bad:* A gear floating next to a paper.
    *   *Good:* A paper with a gear stamped inside it.
    *   The icon must work at 20px size (even though you are drawing it huge).

**VISUAL STYLE (Swiss International):**
-   **Weight:** HEAVY. Use thick, solid shapes. No thin lines.
-   **Framing:** The icon should fill the entire canvas. It is okay to crop or bleed off the edge.
-   **Aesthetic:** Abstract signage. Think "Airport Icons" or "Road Signs," not "Illustrations."
-   **Color:** 100% Solid **{{color}}** on white.

**Goal:**
Use your best judgment to create the symbol that requires the *least amount of brain power* to understand.
