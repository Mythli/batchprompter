# BatchPrompt

BatchPrompt is a command-line tool that lets you generate text and images in bulk using AI (like OpenAI's GPT models). You feed it a data file (CSV or JSON) and a template, and it produces output for every row in your data.

## Installation

If you are new to Node.js tools, here is how to install BatchPrompt globally on your Linux system.

### Prerequisites

You need **Node.js** (version 18 or higher) and **npm** installed.

1.  **Check if you have Node.js installed:**
    ```bash
    node -v
    ```
    If it prints a version number (like `v20.11.0`), you are good. If not, install it using your package manager (e.g., `sudo apt install nodejs npm` on Ubuntu/Debian).

### Install BatchPrompt

Run this command in your terminal to install the tool globally. This allows you to run the `batchprompt` command from anywhere.
